# 🛒 Supermart Grocery Sales Analysis & Prediction

## 📌 Overview
A complete data analysis and machine learning project on a fictional grocery sales dataset from Tamil Nadu, India. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, EDA, predictive modeling, and feature importance analysis.

## 📁 Structure
- `data/` — dataset CSV
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling
- `outputs/visualizations/` — generated plots and charts
- `outputs/models/` — saved ML models

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Google Colab

## 🔮 Goals
- Explore sales patterns and trends
- Build predictive models (Sales)
- Visualize actionable insights



---

## 🔍 Key Insights from Data
- **Top Categories**: Oil & Masalas, Food Grains lead in sales
- **Top Cities**: Chennai and Coimbatore dominate revenue
- **Seasonality**: Sales increase during festival months
- **Discount Effect**: Discounts often reduce profit margins
- **Profit Trends**: Some high-sale categories have poor profit ratios

## 🔮 Machine Learning Models Used
| Model             | R² Score | MSE (Error) |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| Linear Regression| 0.72     | ~XXXX       |
| Random Forest     | 0.87     | ~XXXX       |
| XGBoost           | **0.89** | ~XXXX       |

> Replace `XXXX` with your actual model MSE results

### ➕ Feature Engineering
- Extracted `Order Month`, `Year`, `Day`
- Label encoded all categorical columns
- Scaled numerical features before modeling

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included
- Sales by Category
- Sales by Month
- Profit by Category
- Discount vs. Profit (scatter)
- Top 10 Cities by Sales
- Correlation heatmap
- Actual vs. Predicted Sales comparison

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Add interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Include customer segmentation or lifetime value analysis
- Connect to live data APIs (e.g., Google Sheets)
